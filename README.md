# bamazon-homework

The purpose of this project is to get data from a SQL table and display it to the user.

Once the user has the data, they are then asked what item they'd like to purchase and the amount of that item.

The users input is saved and used to determine if it is available.

If it isn't available, the user muse change their amount.

If it is available, the user will have their order placed and given a total.
